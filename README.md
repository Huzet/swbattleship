High-level basic operation of the game or application:
-	Game starts with empty grid board 10X10 (Easy, Medium, Hard will determine grid size)
-	Ships are auto generated at random on the grid.
-	Player takes turns guessing points on map trying to destroy enemy ships
-	Once all enemy ships destroyed Player wins, or player runs out of ammo and looses

Game will have several modes (Depending on time):
-	First mode (target practice),  player (human) vs computer. Where a random grid map will be generated with computer ships. Player will guess grid point and try to destroy enemy ship with least amount of guesses.
-	Second mode (computer vs human) both player and computer have randomly generated grid map with ships. Players take turn guessing locations of ships. First player to destroy all ships wins
-	Player vs Player. Both players get random generated grid maps with ships. Players take turn trying to destroy each others ships. First player to destroy the other players ships wins.
